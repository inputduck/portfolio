            <p>I am a very technology minded person and I am quick to pick up new software and new approaches. I love making things and then trying to break them to see how I can make it better next time. I am always open to learning more and get excited about building my skills and abilities. I am a very tactile learner and prefer to be up close working with new challenges so that I can get to grips with them in person.</p>

            <p>I work primarily with front end, using HTML, CSS and Javascipt. I am continually learning and always pushing myself to expand my knowledge in new areas. It is exciting to know that it is a continually evolving discipline and there will always be something new to learn.</p>
